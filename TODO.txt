Problems:
Chronological events not being recorded
Multiple entries in squadron log
Handling wounded scenarios for multiple pilots
    - record recovery date of pilot
	- record date of return for wounded pilots
	- record death of dead pilots
	- never advance time - DONE
	
	- if player is available
		- enable mission button
	- if all players are wounded 
		- disable mission button
		- offer advance time to heal (show date)
	- if some players are wounded 
		- enable mission button
		- offer advance time to heal (show date)
	- if all players are dead 
		- disable mission button
		- disable advance time button

Ju52
Add transport mission
- Officer
- Cargo
- Nighttime parachute drops
Add parachute drop mission

Add mission relevance: i.e. mission assignments are accurate based on period and place
Needs:
- Squadron role
- Mission type
- Mission location
- Target Map
- Target area
- Target Type
- Start Date
- End Date

How it works:
Check for relevant mission
Odds of assigning
Get squadron role ... player or AI doesn't matter
If squadron should be involved in special mission (determine by role)
- Create specific mission type
- With specific target type
- At Target Location


Aircraft inventory
- Start at squadron size + 2
- Add one new best plane each day
- Retire old planes
- Add squadron inventory screen
- Maintain losses
- Lose days if inventory < half

Weather
- separate BOS and RoF config keys
- make sure that thunderstorm is an option
- stack odds instead of absolute

A/G destroyed vehicles and victories be summarized in the AAR summary
vehicles and victories be summarized in the pilot log, I believe there is only total of air victories: again it would be nice to have.

New Events
- Add page and squadron log for aircraft introduced
- Add page and squadron log for aircraft removed from service

Add text to indicate squadron status.
Adjust pilot progress to squadron status. 
Add exceptionally difficult missions with accept/reject button.
Tank statistics are kept separately

Add skin configuration screen
Add ace configuration screen
