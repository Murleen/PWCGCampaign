These are the must haves to get the basic functionality, then you can tweak from here

 

1. The lead aircraft is closest to the active runway (for this 4 ship flight) 
2. The Fake Airfield object "USAAF Florennes NE" is very close to the parking area and oriented in the same direction as the active runway (for this flight)
3. Concert taxi ways is easier on AI than dirt and grass taxi ways
4. The taxi nodes seem to affect AI taxi speed but too few or too many cases issues like (random spinning and loss of orientation)
5. Round the curves with nodes but not too close to keep them on center line
6. Taxi paths that are 90° angles work very well in some instances
7. AI tend to not like taxi paths that run parallel to the takeoff/landing path (during taxi, AI has a tendency to veer off course directly to the takeoff VPP)
8. Note how close the parking area is the active runway.
9. AI skill may have a role to play as well (but not tested fully)

 

Hope this help and we appreciate your work!

To add - This works best for open area airfields
With Command Takeoff set to "No taxi Takeoff"
