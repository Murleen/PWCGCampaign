Key Tests for PWCG 6.0
FlightInformationFactory
FlightPlaneBuilder
ShipConvoyGenerator
MissionBorderBuilder
Target position for every flight type

Add ambient scrambles
Rethink flight keeper in light of many coop players

Flight.createVirtualEscortFlight needs to be removed from flight - post flight generation processing?  i.e. make the flights first and then build dependent flights.
- escorts for flights - rules depends on number of flights, player vs ai,  and coop/sp
- flights to be escorted - rules depends on number of flights, player vs ai,  and coop/sp
    - Never create escort mission for AI
    - In coop make flight small
- intercept targets - can we drive a player formation into an intercept?  probably not.
	- intercept opposing roles.  Need class to generate opposing flight role based on intercept type
	- intercept opposing roles.  Need to add ground units for low alt intercept
- balloon bust - balloon cover for  - rules depends on number of flights, player vs ai,  and coop/sp
- balloon defense - balloon attack for  - rules depends on number of flights, player vs ai,  and coop/sp
- Sea Patrol - really does need an opposing flight - should eb a form of intercept
- enemy scramble - maybe for airfield attacks or offensive flights
- nighttime strategic bombing - supporting flights for night time bomber stream
- nighttime strategic bombing - home defense
- nighttime any - create spotlight decorator
- Large plane sea patrol - opposing flight

Problems:
Chronological events not being recorded
Multiple entries in squadron log
Handling wounded scenarios for multiple pilots
    - record recovery date of pilot
	- record date of return for wounded pilots
	- record death of dead pilots
	- never advance time - DONE
	
	- if player is available
		- enable mission button
	- if all players are wounded 
		- disable mission button
		- offer advance time to heal (show date)
	- if some players are wounded 
		- enable mission button
		- offer advance time to heal (show date)
	- if all players are dead 
		- disable mission button
		- disable advance time button



Weather
- separate BOS and RoF config keys
- make sure that thunderstorm is an option
- stack odds instead of absolute

A/G destroyed vehicles and victories be summarized in the AAR summary
vehicles and victories be summarized in the pilot log, I believe there is only total of air victories: again it would be nice to have.

New Events
- Add page and squadron log for aircraft introduced
- Add page and squadron log for aircraft removed from service

Add text to indicate squadron status.
Adjust pilot progress to squadron status. 
Add exceptionally difficult missions with accept/reject button.
Tank statistics are kept separately

Add skin configuration screen
Add ace configuration screen
